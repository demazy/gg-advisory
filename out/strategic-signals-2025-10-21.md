- **Summary**: The global renewable energy capacity additions reached 582 GW in 2024, but significant bottlenecks in grid infrastructure and investment are hindering progress. To meet the COP28 target of tripling renewable capacity to 11.2 TW by 2030, an annual addition of 1,122 GW is required, highlighting the urgent need for grid enhancements to support this growth.

## 2. Resource Adequacy

- **Summary**: A new partnership between IUCN and IRENA aims to ensure that renewable energy projects not only reduce emissions but also maintain biodiversity and community resilience. This collaboration emphasizes the importance of resource adequacy by integrating environmental considerations into renewable energy deployment, ensuring that resource use does not compromise ecological integrity.

## 3. Project Pipelines

- **Summary**: The report indicates that while record levels of renewable capacity were added, the current project pipelines are insufficient to meet future targets. Accelerated project development and investment are essential to achieve the required growth rate of 16.6% annually through the decade.

## 4. Market Risks

- **Summary**: The renewable energy sector faces significant market risks due to supply chain bottlenecks and insufficient investment. The report calls for governments to adopt bolder renewable targets and integrate them into national climate plans to mitigate these risks and ensure a stable transition to renewable energy.
