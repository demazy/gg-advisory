### Battery Energy Storage Systems: Key to Renewable Power Supply-Demand Gaps
- **SECTION:** Sustainable Finance & Investment
- **PUBLISHED:** 2025-08-27
- **Summary:** Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are vital for addressing the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like solar and wind. They allow for real-time balancing of electricity supply and demand, storing excess energy when production exceeds demand and releasing it during peak times. In 2024, energy shifting accounted for 67% of total electricity storage capacity additions. BESS can be utility-scale or behind-the-meter, with utility-scale systems typically ranging from several megawatt-hours to hundreds of megawatt-hours.
- *Why it matters:*
  - Australian and European businesses can leverage BESS to enhance grid reliability and reduce energy costs.
  - Investors may find opportunities in the growing market for energy storage solutions.
- **Signals to watch:**
  - Monitor developments in BESS technology and regulatory frameworks supporting energy storage.
