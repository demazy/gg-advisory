- **Battery Energy Storage Systems: Key to Renewable Power Supply-Demand Gaps**
  - **SECTION:** Energy Transition
  - **PUBLISHED:** 2025-08-27
  - **Summary:** The integration of renewable energy sources like solar and wind necessitates flexible power grids to address supply-demand gaps. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) provide this flexibility by storing excess electricity during low demand and releasing it during peak times. Since 2018, energy shifting has accounted for 67% of total electricity storage capacity additions in 2024. BESS can be utility-scale or behind-the-meter, serving various applications from grid management to residential energy savings.
  - *Why it matters*
    - Enhances grid reliability for businesses relying on renewable energy.
    - Supports compliance with increasing renewable energy integration regulations.
  - **Signals to watch**
    - Monitor developments in BESS technology and capacity expansions.
