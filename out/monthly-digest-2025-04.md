### Importance of Early-Stage Financing
- **SECTION:** Sustainable Finance & Investment
- **PUBLISHED:** 2025-04-03
- **Summary:** Early-stage project financing is crucial for the development of renewable energy projects, which require substantial upfront investments for feasibility studies, environmental assessments, and financial structuring. Without adequate funding during these preparatory phases, many projects remain unbankable, delaying their progress. The IRENA highlights that while well-structured projects can achieve financial closure within 6-15 months, many struggle for years due to insufficient early-stage financing.
- *Why it matters*  
  - Australian and European investors should focus on financing solutions for early-stage projects to facilitate energy transitions.  
  - Addressing funding gaps can accelerate the deployment of renewable energy, aligning with national and international climate goals.
- **Signals to watch**  
  - Increased emphasis on financing mechanisms for early-stage renewable projects in upcoming climate finance discussions.
