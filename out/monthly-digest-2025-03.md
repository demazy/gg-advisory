  - **SECTION:** Energy Transition
  - **PUBLISHED:** 2025-03-04
  - **Summary:** The COP28 UAE consensus aims to triple the Middle East's renewable energy capacity to 11.2 terawatts by 2030, with a focus on off-grid solutions to enhance local energy access. Despite progress in reducing global electricity access deficits, Sub-Saharan Africa remains a challenge, accounting for 83% of those without electricity. Off-grid renewable solutions are crucial for empowering rural communities and supporting multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including poverty alleviation and gender equity.
  - *Why it matters* 
    - Australian and EU businesses can engage in off-grid renewable projects in the Middle East and Africa.
    - Investors should consider the socio-economic impacts of off-grid solutions in emerging markets.
  - **Signals to watch** 
    - Monitor developments in off-grid renewable projects and their funding opportunities.
