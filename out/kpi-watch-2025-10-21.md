## 2. TCFD Report Archive Disbandment
**Summary:**  
As of November 2023, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has disbanded following the release of its 2023 status report. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has delegated the monitoring of climate-related disclosures to the IFRS Foundation. The TCFD's website will remain available as a resource, but it will no longer be updated. This transition marks a significant shift in how companies will report on climate-related risks and opportunities moving forward.

*What changes for reporters:*
- Reporters will need to refer to the IFRS Foundation for updates on climate-related disclosures.
- The TCFD's recommendations will still be relevant, but companies may adopt new guidelines from the IFRS Foundation.

*Data & controls:*
- Companies are expected to continue using TCFD recommendations until new IFRS guidelines are established.
- The archived materials will serve as a reference for best practices in climate-related disclosures.
