# Strategic Signals — 2025-10-20

## 1. Grid Adequacy
- **Signal**: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into the grid is leading to concerns about grid stability and adequacy. As more intermittent resources like wind and solar are deployed, grid operators must enhance their capacity to manage fluctuations.
