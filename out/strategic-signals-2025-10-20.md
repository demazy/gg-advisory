- **Summary:** The recent IRENA report highlights that while global renewable capacity additions reached a record 582 GW in 2024, significant bottlenecks in grid infrastructure are hindering further expansion. To meet the COP28 target of tripling renewable capacity by 2030, a staggering 1,122 GW must be added annually from 2025 onwards, necessitating urgent upgrades and expansions in grid infrastructure to accommodate this growth.

## 2. Resource Adequacy

- **Summary:** The report emphasizes the need for enhanced resource adequacy to support the ambitious renewable energy goals. Current energy efficiency improvements are lagging, with only a 1% improvement in 2024 compared to the 4% needed to meet targets. This indicates a critical need for investment in both renewable technologies and energy efficiency measures to ensure that resources are available and effectively utilized.

## 3. Project Pipelines

- **Summary:** The collaboration between IUCN and IRENA aims to accelerate the development of renewable energy projects that are sustainable and beneficial for biodiversity. This partnership is expected to enhance project pipelines by integrating environmental considerations into renewable energy planning, thus ensuring that new projects contribute positively to both energy goals and ecological health.

## 4. Market Risks

- **Summary:** The IRENA report warns of significant market risks due to the slow pace of investment and the need for bold government action to meet renewable energy targets. The current trajectory is insufficient to achieve the necessary growth rates, which could lead to increased volatility in energy markets and hinder the transition to a sustainable energy future. Stakeholders are urged to address these risks through strategic investments and policy frameworks that support rapid deployment of renewable resources.
