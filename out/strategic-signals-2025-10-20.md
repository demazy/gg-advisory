# Strategic Signals — 2025-10-20

## 1. Grid Adequacy
- **Signal**: The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) highlights significant bottlenecks in grid infrastructure that could hinder the integration of renewable energy sources.
- **Implication**: As renewable capacity additions reached 582 GW in 2024, the need for robust grid systems becomes critical to manage this influx and ensure reliability.

## 2. Resource Adequacy
- **Signal**: The global energy intensity improved by only 1% in 2024, falling short of the 4% annual improvement needed to meet energy efficiency goals.
- **Implication**: This indicates a potential mismatch between energy supply and demand, necessitating enhanced resource management strategies to ensure adequacy.

## 3. Project Pipelines
- **Signal**: The collaboration between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and IRENA aims to accelerate renewable energy projects while ensuring they are sustainable and nature-positive.
- **Implication**: This partnership may lead to more robust project pipelines that not only focus on capacity but also on environmental and community impacts.

## 4. Market Risks
- **Signal**: The IRENA report warns of insufficient investment and supply chain bottlenecks that could jeopardize the ambitious renewable energy targets set for 2030.
- **Implication**: Market participants may face increased volatility and risks as they navigate these challenges, potentially impacting project financing and development timelines.
