## 2. TCFD Report Archive Disbandment
**Summary:**  
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has officially disbanded as of October 12, 2023, following the release of its final status report. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has delegated the responsibility of monitoring climate-related disclosures to the IFRS Foundation. While the TCFD website will remain accessible for historical resources, it will no longer be updated. This transition marks a significant shift in the landscape of climate-related financial reporting, emphasizing the need for companies to adapt to new monitoring frameworks.

*What changes for reporters:*
- Reporters will need to familiarize themselves with the IFRS Foundation's guidelines for climate-related disclosures.
- The TCFD's recommendations will still be relevant but will now be under the oversight of a different organization.

*Data & controls:*
- Companies must ensure compliance with IFRS Foundation standards for climate disclosures, which may differ from TCFD guidelines.
- Historical data from TCFD will remain available, but reporters should verify the applicability of past recommendations under new oversight.
