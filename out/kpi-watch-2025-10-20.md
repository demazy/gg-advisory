## 2. TCFD Report Archive Disbandment
**Summary:**  
As of November 2023, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has disbanded following the release of its 2023 status report. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has tasked the IFRS Foundation with overseeing climate-related disclosures moving forward. The TCFD report archive will remain accessible as a resource, but no further updates will be made. This transition marks a significant shift in the landscape of climate-related reporting, emphasizing the need for companies to adapt to new oversight mechanisms and maintain compliance with evolving disclosure standards.

*What changes for reporters:*
- Reporters must familiarize themselves with the IFRS Foundation's new guidelines for climate-related disclosures.
- Companies may need to adjust their reporting frameworks to align with the new oversight structure.

*Data & controls:*
- Companies should ensure their climate-related disclosures meet the IFRS Foundation's standards.
- Ongoing monitoring of compliance will be essential as the new framework is implemented.
