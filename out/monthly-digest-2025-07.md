- **Headline:** Decentralised Renewables in Rural Zimbabwe
  - **SECTION:** Energy Transition
  - **PUBLISHED:** 2025-07-02
  - **Summary:** Decentralised renewable energy (DRE) has significantly improved healthcare services in rural Zimbabwe, supporting over 180,000 deliveries annually. Many health facilities faced challenges due to unreliable electricity, impacting care quality. DRE solutions have provided 55% of new electricity connections in Sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2022, demonstrating their potential to enhance healthcare delivery in underserved areas.
  - *Why it matters*
    - This model can inform similar initiatives in AU and EU rural healthcare sectors.
    - Investors may find opportunities in DRE projects that address energy access in developing regions.
  - **Signals to watch**
    - The ongoing expansion of DRE in Sub-Saharan Africa could influence investment trends in renewable energy.
