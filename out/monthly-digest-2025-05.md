- **Headline:** Iberian Power Blackout Analysis
  - **SECTION:** Energy Transition
  - **PUBLISHED:** 2025-05-28
  - **Summary:** A major blackout on the Iberian Peninsula on April 28, 2025, affected 55 million people during a business day. The European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENSTO-E) is investigating the incident, which underscores the need for robust power system restart plans. Similar blackouts have occurred globally, including in Chile and Sri Lanka, raising concerns about the frequency of such events. The swift restoration of power within 12-16 hours highlights the importance of preparedness in energy systems.

- **Headline:** Insights from US Energy Infrastructure
  - **SECTION:** Energy Transition
  - **PUBLISHED:** 2025-05-12
  - **Summary:** Observations from a recent trip to the US reveal challenges in low-voltage electrical infrastructure, particularly in California. The low voltage (120 volts) requires small transformers that may not cope with increasing loads from electric vehicles. This could lead to higher costs and more frequent transformer replacements, impacting the overall energy system's efficiency.
  - *Why it matters:*
    - Australian utilities may need to reassess their infrastructure strategies in light of similar challenges.
    - Investors should consider the implications of aging infrastructure on energy costs.
  - **Signals to watch:**
    - Potential shifts in regulatory frameworks addressing infrastructure upgrades.
