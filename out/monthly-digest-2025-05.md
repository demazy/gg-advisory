- **Iberian Power Blackout Analysis**
  - **SECTION:** Energy Transition
  - **PUBLISHED:** 2025-05-28
  - **Summary:** A major blackout on the Iberian Peninsula on April 28, 2025, left 55 million people without power. The European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENSTO-E) is investigating the incident, which underscores the need for robust power system management. Similar blackouts have occurred globally, including a near-total blackout in Chile affecting 80% of its population and significant outages in Sri Lanka and Cuba. The swift recovery from the Iberian blackout, within 12-16 hours, emphasizes the importance of effective restart plans.

- **Insights from the US Energy Sector**
  - **SECTION:** Energy Transition
  - **PUBLISHED:** 2025-05-12
  - **Summary:** Observations from a recent trip to the US highlight challenges in low-voltage electrical infrastructure, particularly in California. The US operates on a 120-volt system, which complicates the integration of new technologies like electric vehicles (EVs). The reliance on small transformers may lead to increased costs and reduced lifespan due to heat stress from rising loads.
  - *Why it matters:*
    - Australian and European utilities may need to reassess their infrastructure to accommodate evolving energy demands.
    - Investors should consider the implications of infrastructure resilience on future energy costs.
  - *Signals to watch:*
    - Potential shifts in regulatory frameworks addressing infrastructure upgrades.
