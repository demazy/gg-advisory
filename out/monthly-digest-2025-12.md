  - **SECTION:** Energy Transition
  - **PUBLISHED:** 2025-12-30
  - **Summary:** In rural Bajura, Nepal, micro hydro power (MHP) is providing reliable electricity to communities, significantly impacting local livelihoods. With over 29.6 million people in Nepal, many in remote areas lack access to electricity. MHP projects, supported by the Government of Canada and IRENA, are crucial for promoting decentralized renewable energy (DRE) solutions, enhancing resilience against climate change, and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. By 2024, Nepal's off-grid hydropower capacity reached 36,544 megawatts, connecting 921,000 people.
