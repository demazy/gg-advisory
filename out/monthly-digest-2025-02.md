### Tripling off-grid renewables for sustainable development
- **SECTION:** Sustainable Finance & Investment
- **PUBLISHED:** 2025-02-24
- **Summary:** The COP28 UAE consensus aims to triple global renewable energy capacity to 11.2 terawatts by 2030, with a focus on off-grid solutions. These initiatives are vital for enhancing electricity access in rural and remote communities, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, which now accounts for 83% of the global access deficit. Off-grid renewable energy systems, such as solar home systems and mini-grids, have already benefited 155 million people in 2023, providing essential services and supporting local economies. The push for off-grid solutions aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in emerging markets.
- *Why it matters:*
  - Australian and European businesses can explore investment opportunities in off-grid technologies to meet sustainability targets.
  - Compliance with international energy commitments may necessitate increased focus on renewable energy projects.
- **Signals to watch:**
  - Monitor developments related to the COP28 commitments and their implementation timelines.
