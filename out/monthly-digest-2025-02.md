  - **Summary:** The COP28 UAE consensus has committed to tripling installed renewable energy capacity to 11.2 terawatts and doubling energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Off-grid renewables are vital for expanding electricity access, especially in rural and remote areas, where 83% of the global access deficit now resides. From 2014 to 2022, the number of people without electricity decreased from 1 billion to 685 million, but progress has stagnated since 2018. Off-grid solutions like solar home systems and mini-grids have already benefited 155 million people in 2023, driving socio-economic growth and supporting multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
  - *Why it matters:*
    - This commitment presents opportunities for Australian and European businesses to invest in off-grid renewable technologies.
    - Compliance with global energy targets may require adaptation of local energy policies and infrastructure investments.
  - *Signals to watch:*
    - Monitor progress towards the 2030 renewable energy capacity and efficiency targets.
    - Watch for emerging funding opportunities in off-grid renewable projects.
