  - **Summary:** The COP28 UAE consensus aims to triple installed renewable energy capacity to 11.2 terawatts and double energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Off-grid renewables are vital for expanding electricity access, particularly in rural Sub-Saharan Africa, which now accounts for 83% of the global access deficit. Off-grid solutions like solar home systems and mini-grids have already benefited 155 million people in 2023, driving progress in multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as poverty alleviation, gender equity, and food security.
  - *Why it matters* 
    - Australian and European businesses can leverage off-grid solutions to meet sustainability targets and enhance market access in emerging economies.
    - Investors may find opportunities in financing off-grid renewable projects that align with SDGs and climate goals.
  - **Signals to watch** 
    - Monitor the progress towards the 2030 renewable energy capacity target.
    - Watch for emerging policies supporting off-grid renewable initiatives.
