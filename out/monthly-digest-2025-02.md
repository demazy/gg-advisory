  - **Summary:** The COP28 UAE consensus aims to triple installed renewable energy capacity to 11.2 terawatts and double energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Off-grid renewables are vital for enhancing electricity access, particularly in rural areas, where 83% of the global access deficit now resides. From 2014 to 2022, the number of people without electricity decreased from 1 billion to 685 million, but progress has stagnated since 2018. Off-grid solutions like solar home systems and mini-grids have provided electricity to 155 million people in 2023, supporting various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including poverty alleviation and gender equity.
  - *Why it matters*
    - Australian and European businesses can leverage off-grid solutions to meet sustainability targets and enhance community engagement.
    - Investors may find opportunities in the growing off-grid renewable sector, especially in emerging markets.
  - *Signals to watch*
    - Monitor progress towards the 2030 renewable capacity and efficiency targets.
    - Watch for developments in funding and support for off-grid renewable projects.
