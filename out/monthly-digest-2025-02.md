  - **Summary:** The COP28 UAE consensus aims to triple installed renewable energy capacity to 11.2 terawatts and double energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Off-grid renewables are vital for expanding electricity access, particularly in rural and remote areas, where 83% of the global access deficit is now concentrated. From 2014 to 2022, the number of people without electricity dropped from 1 billion to 685 million, but progress has stagnated since 2018. Off-grid solutions like solar home systems and mini-grids have benefited 155 million people in 2023, driving socio-economic growth and supporting multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
  - *Why it matters:*
    - Australian and European businesses can leverage off-grid solutions to meet sustainability targets and enhance community engagement.
    - Investors may find opportunities in emerging markets where off-grid renewables are expanding.
  - *Signals to watch:*
    - Monitor progress towards the 2030 renewable energy capacity and efficiency targets.
    - Assess the impact of off-grid solutions on local economies and SDGs.
