  - **Summary:** The COP28 UAE consensus has committed to tripling installed renewable energy capacity to 11.2 terawatts and doubling energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Off-grid renewables are essential for expanding electricity access, especially in rural areas where the access deficit has increased. In 2023, off-grid solutions benefited 155 million people, supporting multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as reducing energy poverty (SDG7) and promoting gender equity (SDG5). The focus on off-grid systems like solar home systems and mini-grids is vital for driving socio-economic progress in underserved communities.
  - *Why it matters*
    - This commitment presents opportunities for Australian and European businesses to invest in off-grid renewable technologies.
    - Compliance with global sustainability goals may require adaptation of local energy policies and investments.
