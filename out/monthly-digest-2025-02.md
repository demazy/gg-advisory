  - **Summary:** The COP28 UAE consensus has committed to tripling installed renewable energy capacity to 11.2 terawatts and doubling energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Off-grid renewables are vital for enhancing energy access, particularly in rural and remote areas, where 83% of the global electricity access deficit now resides. From 2014 to 2022, the number of people without electricity decreased from 1 billion to 685 million, but progress has stagnated since 2018. Off-grid solutions like solar home systems and mini-grids have provided electricity to 155 million people in 2023, fostering socio-economic development and supporting multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
