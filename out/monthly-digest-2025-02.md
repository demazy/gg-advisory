  - **Summary:** The COP28 UAE consensus aims to triple global renewable energy capacity to 11.2 terawatts and double energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Off-grid renewable solutions, such as solar home systems and mini-grids, are essential for expanding electricity access, particularly in rural Sub-Saharan Africa, which now accounts for 83% of the global access deficit. These systems have already benefited 155 million people in 2023, driving progress in multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including poverty alleviation, gender equity, and food security.
